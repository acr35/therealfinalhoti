    <p> Communication is the one need humans seek all day, every day. Internet is all about connecting individuals to
        other individuals, or o information. For the average person, the TV industry was very difficult to get into, but
        YouTube changed this by enabling people to broadcast themselves on an internet website where peers could see their
        content.Digg was an internet company focused on aggregating news that was valued by the users.
        The more people who vote for a given story, the more prominent it gets on the site. Digg was putting
        out the message that a simple blog could be just as informative as the New York Times. Gives more power to the
        people (wisdom of the crowds). There were developments when music was combined with the internet and computers
        by people such as David Weekly, Cabel Sasser, Steve Frank, and Justin Frankel. They discovered how personal
        computers could put tunes together. They were all pioneers in the field of MP3. MP3 could compress audio files;
        it was a digital audio coding format. Media players such as Winamp were developed for personal computers.</p>

        Shawn Fanning developed Napster, a file sharing platform that was popular in downloading audio files from one
        computer’s hard drive to another. In June 1999, Fanning finished the code for Napster and shared it with his
        friends. Within weeks, 10 thousand people had downloaded Napster. 75-80% of University bandwidths nationwide
        were used to download audio files using Napster. It reached 1 million downloads in just weeks after it was
        created.</p>

<div class="text3">
    <p>
        Hilary Rosen, the head of the Recording Industry Association of America, contacted Napster to inform them that
        sharing the audio like that was illegal because of copyrights on music records. Howard King and Peter Paterno
        were L.A entertainment lawyers. They realized that the power of file-sharing could be the end of the movie, music,
        book, and other entertainment industries’ revenue. May 3, 2000 – Lars Ulrich and his lawyers spoke to Napster
        about banning users that had shared Metallica songs because they were copyrighted. RIAA filed a lawsuit against
        Napster, causing Napster to shut down in July of 2001. Viacom launched a lawsuit against YouTube for copyrighted
        material that was on YouTube. Using Google’s resources, YouTube avoided being shut down like Napster was. Google
        bought YouTube in 2006. Web2.0 refers to social website, user-generated websites, and rich web applications.
        MySpace grew in popularity by summer of 2005. It was a social networking website where users discussed music
        among other topics. Facebook grew from a social networking platform that was made for Harvard students to a
        platform used by 50 million active users.
